The article is about a new 3D scanner that you can take anywhere on the go. The scanner has 240 minutes of continuous scanning time, with a 0.01 mm to 0.02 mm accuracy, resulting in impressive accuracy when rendered. It uses AI to detect edges and a multi axis turntable to optimize scanning experience.

I think this technology will be very useful especially for game developers who are looking for a real life object they would like to put into their game. Games like Call Of Duty need real-sized objects in the game, prompting game developers to use 3D scanners. However, their scanners are bulky and difficult to move around. With this new technology, game developers can speed up their game production and save on resources.
