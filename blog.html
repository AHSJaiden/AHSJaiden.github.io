<p>People like games because they are fun. They are an escape from reality which makes it enticing to try out. Games are like guilty pleasures that usually are kept secret. It also creates the image of a winner and a loser, making the game feel somewhat important. All throughout history, humans have been playing games to pass time, practice, or learn strategies.</p>

<p>I highly disagree with this reviewer. In the review he complains about how players are constantly holding angles and spawn camping him in a specific mode. This problem is easily fixed if this reviewer would stop playing that specific mode and actually play other, better modes and get familiarized with the feel of the game. This reviewer also complains about sharp corners and how unnatural it is to check them, but honestly if you keep playing the game you will get used to checking these corners.</p>

<p>I chose a desktop because personally I donâ€™t move around much. I like this desktop because It has top-of-the-line parts, giving me the capability to easily stream, play games, edit videos, etc. I chose NZXT because I personally love their case designs and they match with my setup at home.</p>

<p>Games are good for a number of reasons. It could be the competitive aspect, casual aspect, story, details, etc. FPS are probably the most popular games in esports. FPS games include Valorant, CS:GO, Overwatch 2, Rainbow 6 Siege, and Call Of Duty. In my opinion, Valorant and Call Of Duty are the best games within the FPS genre. The worst games in that genre would be CS:GO and Overwatch. The best ones are good because they are modern, have a good community, are competitive, and have many active players. The worst games are bad because they are outdated, have a bad reputation, and have bad customer service.</p>

<p>Toxicity in games is a major problem, and it will continue growing as more and more people are being exposed to the internet. Toxicity in games, simply put, is conveying your negative emotions towards someone else online; a form of cyberbullying. It is important to understand and put an end to because it will create a better environment for people to learn and enjoy. Some ways to combat toxicity in games include:</p>
<ul class="a">
  <li>Rewarding good behavior, giving incentive to become a behaved player.</li>
  <li>Discouraging bad behavior by communications banning, que banning, and chat banning.</li>
  <li>Using AI, it can auto-detect explicit words/hateful words, banning the offender on the spot. </li>
</ul>

<p>EG is my favorite professional Valorant team. Their roster is composed of experienced pros like Ethan and Boostio, while also incorporating new talent, like Demon1, c0m, and Jawgemo. They have great team chemistry, and they let lose even in the most high-stakes tournaments. For example, EG just won their first international championship, VCT Champions 2023. I think their strategies should be constantly evolving to better fit the ever-changing meta in Valorant. This will guarantee their spot as the best Valorant team in the world.</p>
