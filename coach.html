<h2>Valorant Q&A</h2>
<p>Q. How do you get good at the game/ How do you play?</p>
<p>Valorant is made to be played with a mouse and keyboard. For newer players to the genre, the first step is to get used to the mapping of the keyboard and controls. Valorant is game that requires time to get skilled at the game.</p>
<p>Q. Are there specific strategies that you suggest for people?</p>
<p>Strategies are learned from playing the game consistently and learning from players who are more skilled. Some good strategies include: Faking a bomb site, splitting, and playing default.</p>
<p>Q. Is it difficult to pick up?</p>
<p>Valorant was developed to be an FPS title that was easy to understand and play. However, in my opinion as a former console gamer, I think Valorant is difficult to pickup if the player does not have prior experience in computer games.</p>

<h2>Mechanics</h2>

<p>Counter-Strafing</p>
<p>Counter Strafing is a method used to make you harder to hit while maintaining accuracy with your own bullets. 
To do this, simply press "A" and then hit "D" to create a break in your momentum. This small window of stillness allows you to shoot your bullets accurately, even when the character looks like it is still moving.</p>
<p>Crosshair Placement</p>
<p>Crosshair placement is the act of keeping your crosshair at head level. With this particular weapon I am using, it takes 4 body shots to kill but only 1 shot to the head to kill. This will make winning 1v1 duels so much easier, as the enemy can be killed in an instant.</p>
<p>Wide Peaking</p>
<p>In a situation where you know where the enemy is, you can throw off their own crosshair placement by swinging wider than they expect, making them miss their bullets and giving you a free kill. In this example, I swung into the enemies crosshair, which resulted in me dying instantly. However, the next time I peak him, I wide peak.</p>
<p>Timing</p>
<p>Timing is a very important aspect in Valorant. In a 1v1 situation like this one, the enemy makes a mistake by making noise. I hear this, and I take advantage of this by peaking him where he isn't looking. With the right timing, you can guarantee a free round win for your team.</p>
<p>Wall-Banging</p>
<p>Wall-Banging is also a important in Valorant. If the enemy is revealed with your teams utility, you can shoot through certain boxes and get a free kill. This also goes the other side; if you are hiding in a corner and you get scanned, in most cases you should hide behind a non-spammable object.</p>
